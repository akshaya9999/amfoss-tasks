# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
Based on my understanding of the club, I beleive this club is looking for individuals who have a deep craving for learning new things and improving themselves . I would say I'm exactly that. When I first attended the hacktober fest,I felt so out of place and felt like I didn't know anything. But I was determined to learn and understand as much as I can and I did exactly that and I was able to complete the terminal hunt task. I constantly want to learn and improve my knowledge and become more efficient and I think that is a quality which will be appreciated by the club.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I was really drawn to the hackerrank task and the internet explorer task. Eventhough I couldn't complete all the questions of hackerrank , I really liked the way it challenged me and made me think.I also really liked the possibilities javascript has to offer .So I'll try to learn more about these in the coming days.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will give my best and try to create and share commendable projects.If selected,I will be an active member who will not only try to do the best for myself but also help the members in whatever way I can .
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I found the selection process to be really good . It pushes the candidates to learn many things in a relatively short amount of time and also helps us in identifying our areas of interests.It also teaches us how to be efficient and of course how to google better.
