<h1>Flame Game</h1>

This was one of the hardest tasks that I did.Initially I refered to some YouTube videos and did the task but used a joystick instead of buttons.But then I had to change it and I couldn't find the right functions.I first thought you had to insert button sprites and then give them functions.But then I found a website explaining the inbuilt functions.I was able to complete the task with the help of those websites and overall this task was pretty challenging for me.
