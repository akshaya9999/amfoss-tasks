<h1>INSTALLING UBUNTU 22.04 LTS</h1>

I had a hard time with this task.The task itself was pretty doable but I faced some problems along the way.
The first time I did it,I got to the last part but Ubuntu was just not installing.It showed "error copying files to hard disk".
Now I could'nt figure out why I was getting this error so I tried installing it again but it was again showing error.So this time I tried making a different set of partition and I actually made a new partition table(should not have done that).I got an error this time as well but when  I powered off my device it somehow deleted all the partitions.So now my windows was gone and my laptop became an empty box.I then went to the IT dept. and reinstalled windows.After my windows was running again I tried dual booting it again and this time took extra care to not make any mistakes and was finally able to dual boot my laptop.Throughout the entire process I reffered several youtube videos.

In conclution, through this task I was able to learn and know more about my system and also learn various keyboard shortcuts.
