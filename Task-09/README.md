<h1>Crypto Scrapper</h1>

I started this task but encountered some problems along the way.I had to split data which was in the same class into two ,the thing is I knew that I had 
to use vectors and create something like a list and then split the values .But I was just not getting the right syntax or format to do so.So I was not able 
to advance forward in this task but I will continue to try and get the solution to it even after the submission .
