<h1>cs50</h1>
I completed week 0 of cs50 and was not able to do the rest due to shortage of time .

<h2>Week 0</h2>
For week 0 I made a BANANANAA game .The game is pretty simple , make sure the monkey doesn't get to the banana .You can use the arrow keys to move and if 
you manage to do that for 15 sec,you will win.

The following is the link to my project.
